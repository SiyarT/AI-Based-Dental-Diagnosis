# AI-Based Dental Diagnosis from X-Rays 

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
This project aims to develop an AI model that can analyze dental X-rays to detect problems such as cavities, gaps, tartar, and other issues. The system will also suggest potential treatments like fillings, extractions, root canals, or fissure sealants.

## Background
Many dental issues are not easily visible without X-ray imaging. Early detection of dental problems can prevent serious health complications. This project aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce human error, allowing dentists to provide better and faster treatment plans.

## How is it used? 
1. A dentist uploads an X-ray image to the system.
2. The AI model processes the image and identifies potential dental issues.
3. The system provides a report highlighting the detected problems and suggesting appropriate treatments.
4. The dentist reviews the AI's recommendations and makes a final decision.

## Data Sources and AI Methods
- Data: Dental X-ray images from public datasets and anonymized clinical data.
- AI Techniques: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition, Deep Learning models for pattern analysis.

## Challenges 
- Ensuring high accuracy to avoid misdiagnosis.
- Obtaining a sufficient amount of high-quality labeled data.
- Ethical concerns regarding patient data privacy.

- ## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SiyarT/AI-Based-Dental-Diagnosis.git

## What next? 
- Expanding the dataset with more diverse images.
- Collaborating with dental professionals for model validation.
- Developing a user-friendly application for integration into dental practices.

## Acknowledgments 
- Open-source datasets used for training.
- Contributions from the AI and dental communities.
